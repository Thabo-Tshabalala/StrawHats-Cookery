## Interacting with the live project   
-Install the CeloExtensionWallet from the Google Chrome Store.
Create a wallet.
Go to https://celo.org/developers/faucet and get some token for the alfajores testnet. (Untick the checkbox if "only Celo is ticked")
Switch to the alfajores testnet in the CeloExtensionWallet.
Tip💁 :To test this DApp properly, you should create two accounts. This will allow you to see how the first account earns cUSD when you buy a product with the second account..vice versa.
